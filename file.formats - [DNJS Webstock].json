This form of data compression is more efficient and effective than older methods (Z, ZIP, GZ, etc) but it is a slower process. Conversion is accomplished by taking data in blocks (100-900 kB in size) and using the Burrows-Wheeler transformation to convert characters which occur regularly into strings of identical letters, then applying “move-to-front” transformation and Huffman coding. The earlier BZIP used arithmetic coding.
